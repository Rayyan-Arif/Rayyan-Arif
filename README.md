Meet Rayyan Arif 👋
A developing developer who codes for fun (until the fun turns into debugging 😄).

I build projects to learn, experiment, and turn ideas into real-world applications. From breaking things to fixing them, every project helps me grow as a better problem solver and software engineer.

Tech I work with:
C++ • Java • Web Development • DBMS

Learning never stops—I keep building, improving, and pushing my limits.
Check out my repositories to see my journey (and yes, some questionable creativity along the way).
